# mortgage-calculator

1. Clone the repository and change your directory to `mortgage-calculator-app`.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run test:unit`. See that all tests pass.
4. Run `npm run serve`.
5. In your browser, navigate to the url that the npm run serve command tells you to go to. For me, it was [http://localhost:8081/](http://localhost:8081/). However, it maybe be [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/).
